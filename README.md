## Usage

### Basic Thinking (Unchanged)

#### 1. Start a Thinking Session

```python
start_thinking_session(
    problem="How to build a recommendation system?",
    success_criteria="Scalable system with <100ms response time",
    constraints="Limited to open source tools, $1000 budget"
)
```

### ðŸ†• Coding Integration Usage

#### 1. Start a Coding Session (Enhanced)

```python
start_coding_session(
    problem="Build REST API for user management",
    success_criteria="Secure, scalable endpoints with automatic documentation",
    constraints="Must integrate with existing Django app",
    codebase_context="Django 4.2 project with PostgreSQL",
    package_exploration_required=True  # Automatic package discovery
)
```

#### 2. Explore Packages Before Coding

```python
# Discover relevant packages automatically
packages = explore_packages("web framework async", "python")
# Returns: FastAPI, Django, Flask with relevance scores and installation status

# Get package suggestions in thoughts
add_coding_thought(
    "Need async web framework for high performance API",
    explore_packages=True  # Automatically suggests relevant packages
)
```

#### 3. Prevent Code Reinvention

```python
# Check if you're reinventing existing functionality
result = detect_code_reinvention(
    proposed_code="def custom_http_client(): # custom HTTP implementation",
    existing_packages_checked="requests, httpx"
)
# Returns confidence score and alternative suggestions
```

#### 4. Track Architecture Decisions

```python
record_architecture_decision(
    decision_title="Web Framework Selection", 
    context="Need high-performance API with automatic documentation",
    options_considered="FastAPI, Django REST, Flask-RESTful",
    chosen_option="FastAPI",
    rationale="Built-in OpenAPI docs, type hints, async support",
    consequences="Newer ecosystem, learning curve for team"
)

# Query previous decisions for consistency
similar_decisions = query_architecture_decisions(technology="web framework")
```

### 2. Add Sequential Thoughts

```python
add_thought(
    content="First principle: recommendations match user preferences based on behavior patterns",
    confidence=0.9
)

add_thought(
    content="Need to collect user interaction data: clicks, purchases, time spent",
    dependencies="thought_id_1",
    confidence=0.8
)
```

### 3. Create Alternative Approaches

```python
create_branch(
    name="collaborative_filtering",
    from_thought="thought_id_2", 
    purpose="Explore user-user similarity approach"
)

add_thought(
    content="Calculate user similarity using cosine similarity on interaction vectors",
    branch_id="branch_id_1",
    confidence=0.7
)
```

### 4. Analyze Thinking Quality

## Best Practices

### Core Thinking Practices
1. **Start with Problem Decomposition**: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable components
2. **Build Logical Dependencies**: Connect thoughts to show how insights build upon each other  
3. **Use High Confidence for Facts**: Reserve confidence scores above 0.8 for well-established facts
4. **Create Branches for Alternatives**: Explore different approaches using separate reasoning branches
5. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Use session limits to prevent memory issues with large thinking sessions
6. **Revise When New Insights Emerge**: Update thoughts as understanding deepens
7. **Analyze Before Concluding**: Use quality analysis to ensure thorough exploration

### ðŸ†• Coding Integration Best Practices
8. **Always Explore Packages First**: Use `explore_packages()` before implementing new functionality
9. **Document Architecture Decisions**: Record technical choices with full context and rationale
10. **Check for Code Reinvention**: Use `detect_code_reinvention()` regularly throughout development
11. **Leverage Cross-Session Learning**: Query previous decisions for consistent technology choices
12. **Use Specific Task Descriptions**: Better package discovery with detailed, specific descriptions
13. **Maintain Decision History**: Keep architecture decisions up-to-date as context changes
14. **Share Context Across Systems**: Integrate with memory-bank-mcp for unified package knowledge
